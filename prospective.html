        <h2>For Underclassmen</h2>
        <hr class="light">
        <p>Congratulations for thinking about NHS so early in your high school career!
          Now is the perfect time to start accumulating credits.
          You may use the links below to back up your credit sheets and verification letters,
          as well as record credits in advance of applying to NHS.
        </p>
        <p>Before reading the instructions below, please carefully note that you are responsible
          for retaining the paper copies of your own credit sheets and verification letters. We strongly
          encourage that you make backups of your own documents as well. If materials are
          incomplete or improperly submitted after the application deadline, they will
          not be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Any prospective applicant that is caught forging a teacher's signature will be
            exempt from applying to NHS and subject to disciplinary action.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          As an underclassman, you have the option of using the <a href="javascript:redirectIfSignedIn('underclassman.html');">Underclassman Pre-Application</a> to
          keep track of your credits so that you are ready to apply as a junior or senior.
          Alternatively, you may also submit underclassman activity forms
          <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/rydqEPNZiMGVnkw9FPD2" target="_blank">here</a>â€”if so,
          please follow the instructions outlined <a href="index.html#formsAndLinksJump">here</a>. These will be visible on your application as
          soon as they are processed. If you have already uploaded these forms previously, then they will
          be added to your application file as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter your method of keeping track of your activities, out-of-school activity verification letters should
          be submitted <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/WArbXHN9KCtxATweW7n6" target="_blank">here</a>.
          Please follow the instructions outlined <a href="index.html#formsAndLinksJump">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each year, your information will automatically roll over. For example, if
          you start your pre-application as a freshman, your information will transfer to sophomore year, and
          if you continue your pre-application as a sophomore, your information will then transfer to
          junior year as well. We only review final applications for juniors and seniors; the pre-application
          is for your own convenience and will not affect your chances of admission into NHS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions, please read the FAQ below.
          If you still have questions, please email nhs@bxscience.edu.

        <h2>For Juniors</h2>
        <hr class="light">
        <p>We're excited that you're thinking about joining NHS! As a junior in
          NHS, you will be eligible to apply for an NHS board position in May
          and you will have more opportunities to volunteer at events like the Induction Ceremony
          and Graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before reading the instructions below, please carefully note that you

          The application has three main components: the electronic application, the

          Alternatively, you may submit your application all at once using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Xnw4sulCzyjiQX873" target="_blank">this Google Form</a>.
          No matter which method you use, your application should be complete or submitted by the application deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered.
          If you fill out the web app application, you do not need to fill out the Google Form, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also need to submit a scanned <a href="https://www.bxscience.edu/ourpages/auto/2014/4/24/50647616/NHS%20Junior%20Application%202018-2019.pdf" target="_blank">paper copy</a> of the application for verification of hours.
          Your paper application should be identical to your electronic application, and
          signed by the appropriate faculty members. Once you are ready, follow the uploading instructions
          here and submit your paper application <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/q1xfjVhls3w58pvrtHYD" target="_blank">here</a>.

                You may only get credit for events that are not mandatory to maintain membership in a certain club
                or organization. For example, you can get service credit for volunteering at the Kids Walk for
                Kids With Cancer, even though you went with the Cancer Society, because the event was not
                mandatory. You cannot get credit for participating in Big Bronx as a member of the Speech
                & Debate team, since it is a mandatory event for all debaters.

                When you work on your electronic application and add activities for credit, your data
                is saved to a spreadsheet. Once you have uploaded sufficient verification (either the
                paper application or, if outside of school, a letter confirming your hours) to Dropbox,
                the credits will count towards your application. Alternatively, you may submit your
                application all at once using the Google Form. No matter which method you use, your application
                should be complete or submitted by the application deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered.
                If you fill out the web app application, you do not need to fill out the Google Form, and vice versa.
                If you are an underclassman working on your pre-application,
                it is recommended that you upload the paper form and all out-of-school activity letters
                once towards the end of each semester, unless you have no new updates to make to your credits.

                Yes. Applications must be submitted in paper form as well. After it is fully signed, upload a scanned copy to Dropbox. You do not need a Dropbox account for this to work. You can find uploading instructions <a href="index.html#formsAndLinksJump">here</a>.
    For out-of-school volunteer activities, you must get your supervisor to sign a letter of verification, and then upload to Dropbox as well.
    Current NHS members must also scan copies of their signed tutoring credit sheets and upload them to Dropbox.
